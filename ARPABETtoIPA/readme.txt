This is a single function script that converts ARPABET phonetic alphabet to IPA phonetic alphabet. 
It uses the list of ARPABET phoemes/IPA phoemes from the wikipedia article on the ARPABET.

I wrote this to convert CMUdict phoeme transcriptions to IPA transcriptions.
It's not perfect, and I wrote it at 3am. 

It does not handle stresses. 
It does not handle non-deterministic mappings. (AH, AX, AE)
It's kinda dirty, and probably bad code. 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK or write your own.
